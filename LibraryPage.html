<h1>Library App</h1>

<p>Nothing to see here right now. Everything is built on the backend but no user interface has been created.</p>
<p>These are the instructions for this assignment:</p>
<p>Use object-oriented JavaScript to model a public library (w/ three classes: Library, Shelf, & Book). * The library should be aware of a number of shelves. Each shelf should know what books it contains. Make the book object have "enshelf" and "unshelf" methods that control what shelf the book is sitting on. The library should have a method to report all books it contains.</p>
